**Growth mindset** : is a psychological definition which is mean the real understanding that your abilities can be developed as well as you trying to do what you love and what you want irrespective to the results,even if you fail you can DO IT again till you reach your goals.

The opposite of the Growth-mindset is the **Fixed mindset** which is to see your qualities as fixed traits that cannot change , talent is enough to lead to success and effort to improve these talents isn’t required , people who had a fixed-mindset always believe that they are good or bad in something they think they will fail in the things which they believe that they bad in.


We can summarize the differences between the growth mindset and the fixed minset as shown
> |  | **Growth-mindset**  | **fixed-mindset** |
> | -- | -- | -- |
> |   **challenges** | *embraces*   |*avoid*    |
> | **obstacles**   | *persists*   | *loses focus*   |
> | **effort**   | *no pain , no gain*   |*views as fruitless*    |
> | **criticism**   | *learns form*   | *ignores*   |
> | **success of others**   |*is inspired by*    | *views as a threat*   |
> |    |    |    |

For me I am a growth mindset person
* I used to be positive when I do something , and if I fail I will try again 
* I learnt to ask my self these questions when I feel dissappointed to something
   * What was the best part of the day?
   * What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
* I always inspire by the success of others to achive more and higher goals
